Dichos Cubanos

* Tiene el mono virado
* Es traje, pero lo conoci cuando era chaleco
* Es un zero a la izquierda
* Le ronca el merequeten: It's very complicated, it has implications
* Esto en us arroz con mango: Spagetti code? hard to separate
* No le busques cinco patas al gato: Don't look for five legs on the cat; Don't complicate this; Don't look for things that aren't there.
* Si tuviermos ruedas fuermos bicycleta: If we had wheels we'd be bicycles; We are human and have what we have and it's not worth our time to wish we had non human things.
